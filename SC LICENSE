Barclay Amser/Caesium Project App Suite Special Use License

Copyright (c) 2024 Barclay Software, Jupiter Group, Aurorasoft Group

Developers ("Licensee") who agree to the terms of this agreement are hereby, without any
further charge or Cease and Desist complaints from Barclay Software ("Author"), until the
license has expired (an agreed upon will be settled upon during the discussion proccess),
granted full access to the 1.0 version of the Caesium App Suite, which, by full knowledge
of Barclay and the Licensee contain all apps included in the Barclay Amser/Caesiup Project
web desktops and any other official releases of those projects. Licensed apps may not be
edited without the approval of the Author, and will become property of the Author unless
stated otherwise. Added code must be sent to the Authors (at ourjupitergroup@gmail.com) for
testing and approval. Any changes (excluding localization or theme changing) must be approved
by the Authors.

Licensees are, unless stated otherwise by Barclay Software, Jupiter Group, or Aurorasoft Group,
allowed to partially modify the apps in the directory to the extent that they mention Barclay and/or
the Amser/Caesium projects in such a way that users are clear that the apps are based on code
from the Author, Licensees do not attempt to claim the app code as their own, do not attempt to
redistribute  the app code to other parties without knowledge and permission of the Author, do not
attempt to mock or parody the Author, or force users to pay for the right to use the software.
However, Licensees are, with knowledge and permission of the Author, allowed to include the apps in
paid software, as long as a part of the payed software (one dollar per app included) are sent to a
charity chosed by the Author.

Apps included in the Caesium App Suite 1.0 may include apps that are out of date, depreciated, or
based on other open source software. The Author does not have any incentive to update these apps after
the Send Out date (15 March 2025) and may include more apps in later versions of the suite. If the Author
chooses to update apps within the 1.0 version of the suite or create new apps and add them to the 1.0
version, Licensees will have to wait for their current licenses to expire before including updates or new
apps in their code. Developers may request updated or new apps, but the Authors have no incentive to give
out new code to any Licensee. The Authors also reserve the right to terminate any Licensee's license for
any reason. The termination letter will be sent within thirty days of the Effective Date and Licensees will
have those thirty days to submit an appeal, apps may still be used in a Licensee's code for this period.
After the thirty days are over, Licensees will have an extra ten days to remove all app code from their
software. Approved original code added to licensed apps must also be removed. Any links to the original apps
(i.e., https://caesiumapps.pages.dev/browser or another caesiumapps.pages.dev link) may stay in Licensee's
software as the source code is not exposed to the outside world directly.

THE APPS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AFTER THE SEND OUT DATE, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
